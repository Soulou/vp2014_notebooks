in a fresh python3 virtualenv:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
    - easy_install matplotlib==1.3.1
    - easy_install cvxopt==1.1.6 -- no...need to enable glpk
                                    also, 1.1.5 doesn't work...
                                    and 1.1.6 isn't on main website...

    - pip install FuncDesigner==0.5201
